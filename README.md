## Thermostat
This is the business logic to model a simple thermostat, and it is hooked up to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery - all within the browser. Data is added by the user and displayed on the page. The testing framework Jasmine was used to test-drive the development of the code.

### Positives 
- I was able to use JavaScript syntax to write the business logic.
- I was able to TDD the business logic using Jasmine .
- I was able to use JQuery to hook up the interface. 
- I was able to create a working webpage. 

### Areas to work on 
- Need to find a way to add errors to let users know why they cannot increase or decrease the temperature at certain times. 
- Need to make the page more attractive.
